The results show that a small group of customers contributes a large share of total revenue, meaning the business relies heavily on its top spenders. Some product categories clearly generate much more revenue than others, which highlights where the company’s strongest product performance lies. When comparing all orders to Delivered-only orders, the category rankings stay mostly similar, but any differences can show which categories have more cancellations or issues. In the employee analysis, only certain departments have people earning above the department average, which suggests differences in pay ranges or experience levels across teams. For customer loyalty, Gold members are not spread evenly across cities; some locations have far more high-loyalty customers, which could reflect stronger brand presence or higher spending patterns in those areas. Looking at the full loyalty distribution also helps identify cities where customers might be easily upgraded from lower tiers. Overall, these findings point to useful opportunities in customer targeting, product focus, and compensation review.
